-1,ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER: Function called with invalid parameter value.
-2,"ERR_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED: e.g. Function called to use 16bit ADC mode, with 14bit ADC hardware"
-3,ERR_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND: Opening communication failed or time-out during communication occurred.
-4,ERR_INVALID_DEVICE_ID: AvsHandle is unknown in the DLL
-5,ERR_OPERATION_PENDING: Function is called while result of previous call to AVS_Measure is not received yet.
-6,ERR_TIMEOUT: No answer received from device
-8,ERR_INVALID_MEAS_DATA: No measurement data is received at the point AVS_GetScopeData is called
-9,ERR_INVALID_SIZE: Allocated buffer size too small
-10,ERR_INVALID_PIXEL_RANGE: Measurement preparation failed because pixel range is invalid
-11,ERR_INVALID_INT_TIME: Measurement preparation failed because integration time is invalid (for selected sensor)
-12,"ERR_INVALID_COMBINATION: Measurement preparation failed because of an invalid combination of parameters, e.g. integration time of (600000) and (Navg > 5000)"
-14,ERR_NO_MEAS_BUFFER_AVAIL: Measurement preparation failed because no measurement buffers available
